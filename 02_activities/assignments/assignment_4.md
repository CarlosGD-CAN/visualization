# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 

### Visualization 1: Line Chart of Average Occupancy and Capacity Over Time
Software Used:
I used Python with Matplotlib for this visualization due to its flexibility and reproducibility in creating detailed, customizable plots.
Intended Audience:
City planners, social service agencies, and policymakers focused on addressing homelessness.
Message:
This visualization highlights trends in average shelter occupancy and capacity over time, emphasizing periods of strain on the system and identifying potential gaps in resources.
Design Principles:
1.	Substantive: The data was aggregated by date to avoid overwhelming the audience with daily fluctuations and emphasize broader trends.
2.	Perceptual: Distinct colors (blue for occupancy and orange for capacity) with a clear legend were used to ensure the audience could easily differentiate the variables.
3.	Aesthetic: A minimalist design was applied, with gridlines for better readability and appropriate labeling of axes to clarify meaning.
Reproducibility:
The Python code is fully reproducible, as it includes all steps from data loading to plot creation. Sharing the script allows others to replicate and customize the visualization.
Accessibility:
The use of colorblind-friendly palettes ensures inclusivity, and providing the script enables compatibility with assistive technologies.
Impact:
This visualization could influence decisions on shelter resource allocation and emergency response planning.
Data Features:
I focused on daily averages for occupancy and capacity, excluding individual shelter-level details to avoid unnecessary complexity.
Underwater Labour:
Data preprocessing, including cleaning invalid entries, calculating daily averages, and converting date formats, was essential to ensure the visualization was meaningful.

Visualization 2: Bar Chart of Average Occupancy Rate by Shelter Type
Software Used:
I created this visualization in Excel because of its simplicity and widespread accessibility among stakeholders.
Intended Audience:
General public and advocacy groups seeking a high-level overview of shelter usage by type.
Message:
The bar chart highlights differences in occupancy rates across various shelter types, such as family shelters and youth shelters, to identify disparities in resource utilization.
Design Principles:
1.	Substantive: The focus was on average occupancy rates rather than raw counts to ensure comparability across shelter types.
2.	Perceptual: Bar heights were scaled proportionally to the occupancy rate, and category labels were clear and concise.
3.	Aesthetic: A clean, uniform color scheme was applied to minimize distractions, with category names rotated for readability.
Reproducibility:
While Excel is less programmatically reproducible than Python, the steps for creating the visualization were documented, and the dataset is publicly available for replication.
Accessibility:
Legible fonts, clear labels, and high-contrast colors were used to ensure readability. Additionally, the data table underlying the chart was included for transparency.
Impact:
This chart could help identify shelter types that require additional funding or policy intervention to address disparities.
Data Features:
Only the shelter type and occupancy rate were included, as these are directly relevant to the audience's needs. Excess metadata was excluded to maintain focus.
Underwater Labour:
I calculated occupancy rates, removed irrelevant columns, and formatted the data for Excel, ensuring consistency across categories.

Conclusion:
Both visualizations serve distinct purposes: the line chart identifies temporal trends, while the bar chart compares shelter performance. Together, they provide a comprehensive overview of shelter usage in Toronto, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.



   

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
